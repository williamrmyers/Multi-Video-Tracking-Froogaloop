# Multi-Video-Tracking-Froogaloop

This is an example of how to dynamically track your Vimeo Videos with analytics.

Javascript tracks all of the vimeo videos on the page with the class "tracking".

The title is captured from the data-video attribute.

EX: data-video="Video Title"


Currently the data logs Video Played, Paused, and FInished to the console.

Uncomment the Kissmetrics API calls, send the data to Kissmetrics.
